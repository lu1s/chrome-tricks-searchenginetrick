For this, you could find useful, fun, and even more productive (for 
research and KMKT studies) to use different versions of the Alphabet's 
products and services. Yet, since the current stability of the Internet's
DNS in certain places over planet Earth, most commonly in countries that
are under development like LATAM (LACNIC), suffer from several DNS
redirections and attacks that end up in copyright infringements, impersonation,
spionage, phishing, scam, and other forms of information misuse and unlawful
activities. For this. Google provides an open and public DNS service that allows
every person with Internet access that has direct connection to the IPv4 8.8.8.8
and 8.8.4.4, and/or the IPv6 2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888 and 2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8844
can set it up to avoid this kind of attacks or reduce the risk of being a victim of that.

Set up Google's the following Google's public DNSs
for increased speed and security.
