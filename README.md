## Google
Google is one of the most amazing search engines out there,
however, it faces a big security concern when it comes to 
privacy and tracking. For this, you could find useful, fun, 
and even more productive (for research and mkt studies), to
use different versions of the Alphabet's hyper gigant whose
AI already have a human organ's name (creepy but true).
### tl;dr
Use these to use different Google's search engine versions.

## Google search engine query for domain hardcoding:
Follow the steps to add a new search engine in your Chrome
settings, and after doing so (if you really want to forget
about your countrie's Google domain name, feel free to remove
it from the list. This query harcodes both the domain name
and the character encoding (to enforce utf-8).
### tl;dr
If you are freak about privacy read the paragraph above.
Otherwise ignore and just add this as a new search engine:
```
https://www.google.com.au/search?q=%s&{google:RLZ}{google:originalQueryForSuggestion}{google:assistedQueryStats}{google:searchFieldtrialParameter}{google:searchClient}{google:sourceId}{google:contextualSearchVersion}&ie=UTF-8
```
### Final thing
The query above shows the Google Australia fully qualified domain name.
It was picked randomly and you just need to put the working Google's search
domain name. Use Google services according to the terms and conditions and
being concern about their privacy policy to avoid account suspension or
other form of security actions that could be taken from Alphabet, Inc as
prevention. Keep the "ethical hacking" concept in mind first.
#### tl;dr
Use this for good and bye
