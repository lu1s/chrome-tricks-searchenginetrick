## Episode 1: Browse safely and fix your DNSs

### Brief
The Internet we use today provides services for every industry in
the globalized industries of the digital and physical worlds. However,
it faces a big security concern when it comes to privacy rights.
When you go to a website in your browser directly (without first going
to a search engine), your request goes to a directory (DNS) so it can get the
Internet address (IP, either v4 or v6) of the given document.
"Hackers", thieves, malicious users, or however you want to call them; they 
suddenly use tactics that include "snooping" or "intercepting" or "spying" on
that request that was made to the DNS directory. That information is used to make
decisions prior to yours and then sell you or create needs that you do not have
or that do not exist.

##### A Solution [https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns](from Google)
For this. Google provides an open and public DNS service that allows
every person with Internet access that has direct connection to the IPv4 8.8.8.8
and 8.8.4.4, and/or the IPv6 2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888 and 2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8844
can set it up to avoid this kind of attacks or reduce the risk of being a victim of that.

For more information go to [https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns](the Official Google's Public DNS Service) page.

This way, 

```tldr
Set up Google's the following Google's public DNSs
for increased speed and security.
IPv4: 8.8.8.8
      8.8.4.4
IPv6: 2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888
      2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8844
```
